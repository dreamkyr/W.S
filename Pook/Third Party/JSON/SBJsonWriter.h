 @brief The JSON writer class.
 
 Objective-C types are mapped to JSON types in the following way:
 
 @li NSNull -> Null
 @li NSString -> String
 @li NSArray -> Array
 @li NSDictionary -> Object
 @li NSNumber (-initWithBool:) -> Boolean
 @li NSNumber -> Number
 
 In JSON the keys of an object must be strings. NSDictionary keys need
 not be, but attempting to convert an NSDictionary with non-string keys
 into JSON will throw an exception.
 
 NSNumber instances created with the +initWithBool: method are
 converted into the JSON boolean "true" and "false" values, and vice
 versa. Any other NSNumber instances are converted to a JSON number the
 way you would expect.
